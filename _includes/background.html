      As a software developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably listening to music, travelling ,
      or somewhere enjoying tha nature.
